## Disclaimer

This repository contains code and data intended for educational and research purposes (Introductory EEG course for PhD Students, UGR, 2025). While we have made every effort to ensure the functionality and accuracy of the provided scripts, we cannot guarantee that they will work perfectly in all cases or be free of errors.

## Responsibility and Verification

Each user is responsible for carefully reviewing and validating all aspects of the code and results. We strongly recommend double-checking every step of the analyses, including preprocessing, statistical procedures, and result interpretation.

## Individual Analysis Considerations

Different research questions and datasets may require different approaches and parameter choices. Therefore, each user should thoroughly study and critically assess the decisions made in their analyses of interest. If necessary, users should adapt the provided scripts to fit their specific requirements and verify that the results align with their research objectives.

## Contributions and Feedback

If you identify issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to contribute by reporting them or submitting updates to lindedomingo@ugr.es or sokoliuk@ugr.es. Collaboration and critical review help improve the robustness of analyses and code reliability.

## Final Note

We encourage all users to apply good scientific practices, verify their results independently, and consult domain experts when necessary. The provided resources are a starting point, not a definitive solution.
